- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vitor, 20 years old and a Computer Science student.

I'm currently studying C, python and Java at college and learning A.I. and data science with my free time. Although I'm on my fourth semester in Computer Science, I'm very interested in Assembly, reverse engineering, cryptography and topics related to A.I. and computer vision.

In addition to projects I'm making for subjects on my graduation course, here on github I will upload interesting projects that I have finished.
