- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vitor. I'm a Computer Science student.

I'm currently studying C and python on college and learning C++ and opengl in my free time. Although I'm on my third semester in Computer Science, I'm very interested in Assembly, reverse engineering and cryptography.
In addition to projects I'm making for subjects on my graduation course, here on github I have some programs related to sorting algorithms and related stuff.

I'm also working on some projects related to Artificial intelligence and Data Science in python and jupyter notebooks.
