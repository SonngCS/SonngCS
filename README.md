- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vitor, a 22 years old Computer Science student from Brazil.

I'm currently studying C, C++, C# and python at college and learning game development with my free time. I'm on my last semester in Computer Science and I'm very interested in reverse engineering, cryptography and topics related to development.

In addition to projects I'm making for subjects on my graduation course, here on github I will upload interesting projects that I have finished.
