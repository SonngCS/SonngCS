- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vitor. I'm a Computer Science student on his 3nd semester.

I don't know what to type in here, college is basically consuming my life. I study some things here and there, some research projects involving data science, AI and stuff like that. I probably won't frequently update this page until I graduate or get the will to clean and upload some codes I did.
