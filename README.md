- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vitor, 20 years old and a Computer Science student.

I'm currently studying C, python and Java at college and learning A.I. and data science with my free time. Although I'm on my fourth semester in Computer Science, I'm very interested in Assembly, reverse engineering and cryptography.
In addition to projects I'm making for subjects on my graduation course, here on github I have some programs related to sorting algorithms.

I'm also working on some projects related to Artificial intelligence and Data Science in python and jupyter notebooks.
